# HERIT.age
Indigenous communities around the world are among the most forgotten by the current world economy, with limited to or have no access to banking and financial systems.

Due to this many communities are pushed into leaving their ancestral homes for cities, ending up in a loss of culture, music, art, & equity in owning their projects.

The Non-Fungible Economy is the mix between traditions and NFTs. Turning art, music and culture into non-fungible tokens on the Celo Chain.

To properly test the dapp you will need to have a Celo wallet with testnet tokens.
This learning module [NFT Contract Development with Hardhat](https://hackmd.io/exuZTH2hTqKytn2vxgDmcg) will walk you through the process of creating a Metamask wallet and claiming Alfajores testnet tokens.
